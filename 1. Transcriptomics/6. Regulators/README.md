# Transcriptomics - Regulators
1. `CalculateEigengenes.R` - calculate the eigengenes of the significant GO terms.
2. `Network_TF_lncRNA.R` - construct a TF-lncRNA-GO term network to identify potential protein and lncRNA regulators.
3. `GWASnetwork.R` - construct a gene-trait network for the identified lncRNA and protein regulators.
