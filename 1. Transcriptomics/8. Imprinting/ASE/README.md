# Transcriptomics - Imprinting - Allele Specific Expression (ASE)
1. `runBowtie2.sh` - run Bowtie2 to generate BAM files
2. `PrepareASE.sh` - prepare for ASE analysis.
3. `ASE.sh` - get allele-specific expression.
4. `DASE.R` - identify imprinted genes that show differential allele specific expression (DASE).
5. `plotASE.R` - make an ASE plot for a selected SNP.
6. `RegionASE.R` - get differential expression profile for the genes in the region of imprinted genes with ASE.
