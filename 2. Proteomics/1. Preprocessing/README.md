# Proteomics - Preprocessing
1. prepareData.R - prepare proteomics data and perform preprocessing and differential expression analysis.
2. ApoptoticProteins.R - get spatiotemporal expression profile of known apoptotic markers.
3. OverlapGeneProtein.R - match proteins and genes from the proteomics and transcriptomics data.
